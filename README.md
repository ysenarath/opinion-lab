# Opinion Lab

The repository contains codebase for building state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for opinion mining.

Currenly following models have been created and tested:

* Models for IEST @ WASSA-2018 [FNN, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, LSTM-CNN ++]

## Prerequisites
1. Related resources for featureizers (only if you are using them) (ex: lexicons, word-embedding models)
2. Some python knowledge

## Setup the Lab
1. Install [`textkit-learn`](https://github.com/ysenarath/textkit-learn)
2. Configure path to resources in [`oplab/config.py`](https://github.com/ysenarath/opinion-lab/blob/master/oplab/config.py)
3. Happy Experimenting!
